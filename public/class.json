        "description": "Traditionally available only to select groups of yogis, Surya Kriya is being offered by Sadhguru as a comprehensive spiritual practice that is ideal for the hectic pace of today's world.\n\n\"Surya\" means \"sun\", and \"Kriya\" means \"inner energy process\". It is a gentle, slow-paced, 21-step process and is a way of aligning yourself with the sun, the basic powerhouse for this planet. All life on this planet is solar powered, including yourself.\n\nSurya Kriya is an ancient, potent yogic practice that raises the solar heat in the system. It also balances your energy channels, leading to stability of the body and stillness of the mind.",

        "description": "Yogasanas are offered as a set of powerful postures to transform the body and the mind into a possibility for ultimate well-being. They are not taught merely for physical fitness and strength, but are a way of aligning the inner system to the celestial geometry, becoming in sync with the existence, thereby naturally achieving a state of health, joy and bliss.\n\"Your physical health, your psychological wellbeing, and your spiritual possibility depend on how well aligned you are with existence. Essentially, hatha yoga is towards establishing this alignment.\" - Sadhguru",
